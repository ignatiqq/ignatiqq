Correct software architecture is like the result of assembling a spaceship in space. Different countries develop different parts for the spacecraft without even communicating with the engineers who build the other parts of the spacecraft. Each team of engineers has an appropriate part plan and its interface, their part is just a puzzle which was described in the plan (interface). And after all the parts of the ship have been designed, they are simply sent into space individually because it is impossible to assemble the ship on earth and send such a huge thing into space. Each part arriving to the destination point is simply connect to another part, they know what they should be attached to, but have no idea about the realization of the other part of the ship, but each part has an interface (a contract with the other part), and all parts are safely joined in space.

After all, if you assemble the ship as a (realization) whole, any component that fails will render the Whole ship unusable.
